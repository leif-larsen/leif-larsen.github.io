# AGENTS.md

This repo is a Hugo site (PaperMod theme). Keep changes aligned with Hugo content/layout conventions.

## Structure
- `content/` holds pages and posts. Posts live in `content/posts/YYYY/slug.md`.
- Use `layouts/` for template overrides and `data/` for data files.
- `static/` is copied to the site output; use for global assets.
- `public/` and `resources/` are generated by Hugo; do not edit by hand.

## Content + front matter
- Use YAML front matter (`---`) to match `config.yml` and existing posts.
- Required fields: `title`, `date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`). Use `draft: true` for new work unless asked to publish.
- Optional: `tags`, `categories`, `series`, `description`, `slug` when a URL should differ from the filename.
- Keep filenames lowercase with hyphens.

## Page bundles and assets
- For posts with local images/files, use a leaf bundle at `content/posts/YYYY/my-post/index.md`.
- Store images next to `index.md` and reference them with relative paths.
- Leaf bundles cannot contain other bundles; use `_index.md` for section/branch bundles.

## Themes
- Avoid editing `themes/hugo-PaperMod` directly. Override templates in `layouts/` or use site params in `config.yml`.

## Build compatibility
- GitHub Actions builds with Hugo 0.150.1; avoid features newer than that unless you also update the workflow.
