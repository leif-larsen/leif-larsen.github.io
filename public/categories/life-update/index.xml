      <description>At the time of writing, it&amp;rsquo;s been 2 years, 3 months and 25 days since my last blog post. Since that, I have released a book, released the follow-up version, and even a third edition. I have moved four times, including to a new city. I changed my job and joined a startup. I&amp;rsquo;ve met my significant other, and we just had our first child.
 TLDR: Worked hard, both with full time job and side projects.</description>
