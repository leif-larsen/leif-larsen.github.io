      <p>Today I am looking into functional programming. More specifically I’ll look into F#, a strongly typed, multi-paradigm language. Often used as a cross-platform common language infrastructure language.</p>
<p>It is developed by F# Software Foundation, Microsoft and open contributors. It is supported in Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio, and it has its own open source, cross-platform compiler.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>F# was originally designed and implemented by Don Syme, from Microsoft Research, and it was first released in 2005, supporting .NET 1.0 – 3.5, and the Windows platform. Features included functional programming, records, tuples, pattern matching, structs, scripting files, modules and .NET interoperability, to mention a few.</p>
<p>It took about 5 years until the next version was released. This did support Linux and OS X as well, and .NET 2.0 – 4.0 as well as Mono. New features was added, such as asynchronous programming, agent programming, extension members, named arguments and array slicing.</p>
<p>Version 3.0 supported also supported .NET 4.5, as well as GPU and JavaScript platforms. Features like LINQ, auto-properties and type providers were added.</p>
<p>The latest version is F# 4.0, released earlier this year, with the introduction of Visual Studio 2015. Some of the features included is extension property initializers, class names as functions, non-null provided types and optional type args.</p>
<p><strong>Typical uses</strong></p>
<p>This is not a language with a wide variety of applications where it is used. It is a central part of <a href="http://websharper.com/">WebSharper</a>, where you use F# as .NET code on the server, and JavaScript on the front end.</p>
<p>Another place it is used is for analytical programming. It has been positioned as an optimized alternative to C#, and is used for quantitative finance programming, energy trading and portfolio optimization, machine learning and business intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Example Hello World</strong></p>
<p>So for this example you will need a compiler for F#, naturally. There are a few ways to compile code on Windows (5 actually), which you can read about on <a href="http://fsharp.org/use/windows/">fsharp.org</a>.</p>
<p>Assuming you have everything you need to compile some code, lets create a file called HelloWorld.fs. The code should look something like this:</p>
<p>open System [] let main argv = printfn &ldquo;Hello, World!&rdquo; 0</p>
<p>A big warning here! Do not let there be TABs, unless you specify an “#indent “off”” option. My first attempt to compile the code above, <em>with</em> TABs failed. When I removed the TABs and just used whitespace, it compiled fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, compile this file by running the following:</p>
<p>fsc HelloWorld.cs</p>
<p>And given that the compilation succeeded, run the program by running:</p>
<p>HelloWorld.exe</p>
<p>If everything has been done as it should, you should see the all familiar “Hello, World!” printed to the console.</p>
<p>Although I haven’t spent too much time on F#, I imagine I’ll spend some time diving into it sometime next year. It is compatible with many Microsoft products, uses .NET framework, and is being used for machine learning, a topic I’m interested in learning more on later.</p>
<p>That’s it for now, be sure to check back tomorrow for the next part!</p>
