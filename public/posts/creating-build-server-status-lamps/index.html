      <p>Today I decided to do some tinkering with some of the IoT stuff I have laying around. Quite recently I started on another personal project, which I will do quite a bit of work on over the next few months. I decided that it would be good to setup a build server for the project, to be able to build and test the project, so I don&rsquo;t break anything during development.</p>
<p>Since the project is built using C# I decided to set up a build definition in Visual Studio Online, which can get the source code from GitHub. Anyway, with the build definition set up, I thought it would be cool to get instant (or close to instant) feedback without browsing to the web site to see the result. Having a Particle Core (former Spark Core) I hooked it up with a couple of LEDs. The idea was to get a green light on successful build, and a red light on a failed build. Kind of like the build badge you typically find at many GitHub readmes.</p>
<p>Setting up the Core to do as wanted was pretty straight forward. In the documentation they even have a sample for turning LEDs on and off from the internet. I used this sample as my firmware, with some modifications, so that just one of the LEDs is on at any given time.</p>
<p>To be able to control the LEDs it&rsquo;s a matter of calling the right URL with the right parameters. Using Particle Core this is quite easy, as it is a cloud connected device. To automate the process, I decided to try <a href="https://zapier.com">Zapier</a>. Using this it was quite easy to create a Zap that is triggered when a build is completed. This then triggers a web hook action, which calls the correct URL, with the parameters I specify. I just use the free plan for Zapier, as I usually use <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, so I&rsquo;ll have to consider it when I see how it is in the long term. The reason for using Zapier over IFTTT for this, is that IFTTT didn&rsquo;t have any channels for Visual Studio Online, which Zapier did.</p>
<p>The end result looks like this: <img src="/images/IMG_1241.JPG" alt="Failing build"> <img src="/images/IMG_1242-1.JPG" alt="Successful build"> <img src="/images/SucceededBuild.PNG" alt="Build status"></p>
<p>As you can see from the first image the build has failed, and in the next image it has succeeded. This also correlates to the build status in the last image.</p>
<p>A bit messy in terms of cables and such, so I might tidy that up later, but for now it was just a fun Sunday-project.</p>
