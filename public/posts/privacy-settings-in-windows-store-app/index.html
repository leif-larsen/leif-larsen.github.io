      <p>So recently I been working on finishing my first Windows store app. This app (which I will tell more about when it? been released) needs connection to the local network. This meant that this was a permission I would need to get from the user.</p>
<p>Thinking that since I did not store any data from the user, it would not need any privacy policy. This turned out to be wrong, and as I submitted the app, it only took a few hours before the feedback was “rejected”. The notes I got was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The app has declared access to network capabilities and no privacy statement was provided in the Windows Settings Charm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution to this was to create a new page on my domain, add a privacy policy and then add this to the Windows Settings Charm, as well as submit it in the description to the store. To add this to the Windows Settings Charm I found this blog entry, which explains it quite well. Click <a href="http://jimiz.net/2012/12/privacy-policy-windows-store-apps/#axzz2yfnVEnWJ" title="How to add privacy policy to Windows Settings Charm">here</a> to see the blog.</p>
<p>As a policy I submitted the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This application does not share personal information with third parties nor does it store any information about you.<br>
This privacy policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on April 12th 2014. If you have any questions feel free to contact me directly at <a href="mailto:me@leiflarsen.org">me@leiflarsen.org</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion that should be enough, seeing as the app does not really does not store anything. Then it´s just to wait and see if Microsoft feels the same way.</p>
<p>[EDIT April 14th 2014]<br>
I can now confirm that the policy text was enough, as my app was released just today.</p>
