      <p>We’re about to leave 2014 behind, and enter what will be, at least for me, an exciting year.<br>
Through the first month of the year I will participate in a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera">coursera</a> regarding cryptography. This is a free, online course, from Stanford University, lead by Dan Boneh. Cryptography is something I have picked up an interest in lately, alongside with computer security, so it will be interesting to see if I can get some better knowledge around this subject. As far as I can tell it will be interesting to participate in this course, as it will be lectures and assignments, which means I get to test my understanding of the subjects.</p>
<p>Another thing I personally look really forward to is the fact that I start in a new job in February. I go from being a software engineer, working with configuration and development of industrial control systems, to work as a software engineer, with all my focus in programming and development. I have lately felt that this is something I need to do to develop as a developer, and I have realized that it is what I really want to do.</p>
<p>When we came into 2014 I didn’t set any particular goals to myself. I guess you could say I were in at a stage of not really knowing what I wanted to do with the year, and as such I haven’t reached nor not reached any goals. This has changed when we cross the finishing line of 2014. A lot of people state that if you want to reach your goals, you should tell people about them (especially true if you try to change habits, I guess). So I have decided to share most of them here.</p>
<p>Goals should be measurable, so I have tried my very best to put some numbers next to each goal.<br>
My goals for 2015 is the following:</p>
<p>Write at least 25 blog posts. I have wanted to write more posts this year, however I have not actually done it. In 2015 I aim to write a new post at least every other week. I believe that if I can manage this, I can both increase my understanding of the topics I write about, but also get feedback on ideas and my understanding of subjects.</p>
<p>Release at least 3 apps At this moment I have 3 app ideas I would like to see come to life. By making this a goal, it means I have to complete one app per quarter (excluding the summer season!). When thinking about the fact that I start a new job, work out, play guitar and also want some time for family and friends, it might be a bit optimistic. But hey, I like challenges!</p>
<p>Do some kind of work out at least 120 times within the year I am in a good rythm regarding work out now, where I go to the gym three times a week. I’d like to keep that trend going through 2015. Excluding a few weeks with vacation this leaves me at around 120 times. Note that by working out I mean running/jogging/weight lifting/playing soccer/boxing etc.</p>
<p>Improve my programming skills Ok, this is a dogdy one. How do I measure my programming skills? Well, I have a pretty good idea on where I am today, so my goal is to improve by the end of the year. I plan to take one or possibly two certifications from Microsoft, so I will let that be my guide.</p>
<p>I do have some more goals on a personal level, but those are just that, personal. It will be exciting to sit here the last days of December 2015 and summarize my year, to see how it’s been.</p>
<p>Do you have any goals for 2015? Are they achievable?</p>
<p>Anyway, until next time! Have a great new year celebration!</p>
