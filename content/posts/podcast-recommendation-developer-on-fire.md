Recently I started listening to the podcast called [Developer on Fire](http://developeronfire.com/), hosted by [Dave Rael](https://twitter.com/raelyard). Each episodes features a guest, and the whole idea of the show is that Dave talks to each guest while they tell their stories.

The show describes itself like this:

> Podcast with inspiring interviews with successful software developers, architects, testers, and other professionals with stories of success, failure, excellence, and inspiration

In all the episodes I've heard so far, I've picked up quite a bit of inspiration. There is also a great amount of wisdom to learn from the guests, so I highly recommend that you head over to [Developer on Fire](http://developeronfire.com/), or find the show at iTunes or Stitcher. I am definitely looking forward to hear more episodes!
