Today I'm starting a new series of post. Every last Sunday of each month I'll recommend a new blog. Each blog will be one I often read, and find worthwhile to spend time on. The posts will be kept short and to the point, to let you spend more time exploring the blog in questions yourself.

This Sunday I want to recommend [Coding with Empathy](http://codingwithempathy.com/), written by [Pavneet Singh Saund](https://twitter.com/pavsaund). It is a blog that puts a lot of focus on empathy in software development, and how we as developers can become better by focusing more on empathy and soft skills.

##Why I read Coding with Empathy I've been following this blog for some time now, and Pavneet writes well-written and thought-provoking posts. Many which have made me think more about my way of dealing with different aspects of life. He also shares a variety of resources, and my book reading list has increased after reading some of his posts.

##One post to read One post I'd like to point out in particular is one called [You suck at listening!](http://codingwithempathy.com/2016/05/24/you-suck-at-listening/) In this post he goes into how developers (and people in general) tends to jump to conclusions and respond to people based on previous experience. Pavneet argues that if we improve our listening skills, we can communicate better and thus improve our people skills.

Anyway, I recommend you head over to [Coding with Empathy](http://codingwithempathy.com/) now, and read some of the posts there!
