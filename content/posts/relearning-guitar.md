I’ve played guitar since I was around 16 years old. When I first started out I didn’t really do any courses or follow any learning paths, I just tried to play songs I liked, while having fun. I was fortunate enough to join a band, and can safely say that it was great for my skills. Not only did I learn to play fairly well, I also played well with others and on stage. Great times!

Unfortunately the band dissolved. Me and some other friends tried to start a new band, however it didn’t really work out. For this reason my guitar playing decreased throughout the studies, and for the last couple of years it’s practically been no playing at all. So before Christmas last year I came across a guitar I had wanted for a long time and naturally I decided to give myself an early Christmas present!

The guitar in question is a Epiphone Les Paul Black Beauty. Originally I wanted the original Gibson edition, but this looks as good and is a bit cheaper. Sounds really great as well!

Seeing as I bought a new guitar, I felt the need to actually use it. Therefore I picked up playing again, however this time I thought “hey, why not try to learn guitar properly”. So I have been going slowly, teaching myself chords and doing exercises, but not forgetting the fun of playing some of the easier songs I know. In this relearning phase I have been following along with the course hosted by [Justin Guitar](http://www.justinguitar.com/ "Justin Guitar"). I find it to be really good as it takes everything step by step, with both video lectures and written text. I can do it in my own pace, and it’s good for increasing my own enthusiasm of guitar playing. So if you are new to guitar, or simply need to relearn after a long hiatus, then check it out!

Do you play guitar or any other instruments? How was your learning experience?
