Leif is a senior software consultant, focusing on .NET development. He has about 10 years experience in the IT field, and has worked both in-house and as a consultant.

He prefers to work on the backend of systems, but is not afraid to work with frontend technologies.

Over the years, his curiosity has led him to build a couple of mobile applications, using cross-platform technologies. He has also written a book (in three editions) on how to get started with Azure Cognitive Services.

When not working, or exploring different aspects of technology, Leif spends a lot of his time with his son and significant other. He also has a passion for music, and occasionally finds the time to play some tunes on the guitar.
