I’m a technology advisor with over 14 years of experience in software development and cloud architecture. I help organizations design and build scalable, secure, and efficient solutions — always with a focus on creating real business value.

In recent years, I worked as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft, where I supported customers in delivering large-scale digital transformation projects and building resilient solutions on the Azure platform. Before that, I led the development and architecture of mission-critical systems for organizations such as NHO, focusing on cloud-native solutions and enterprise transformation.

My journey began in the industrial sector, developing control systems for offshore vessels, before moving on to modern cloud platforms and cutting-edge technologies. This breadth of experience gives me a unique perspective: I understand both the technical details and how technology can enable strategic business goals.

I’m also passionate about developer well-being and sustainable engineering practices. Through public speaking and knowledge sharing, I highlight how we can balance delivery speed with long-term quality — and how to thrive as a technologist in the process.

Today, I work as an advisor, tech lead, and solutions architect — dedicated to bridging the gap between technical innovation and business strategy.
